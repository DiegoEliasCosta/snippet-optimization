\textbf{Crafting the Dataset.}
In order to evaluate our methods we have created a dataset containing manually extracted solutions from the SO questions.  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item We select the \topquestions most frequently viewed questions on SO tagged with \textit{pandas}. \diego{Add the new libraries}
    \item For each question we select the accepted and most voted answer to include in the dataset. In some cases, the accepted answer is not the most voted answer by the community.
    \item We manually extract the solution by \diego{We need a crisp methodology here}. The second author performed the extraction and each solution was also verified by the first author.  

\end{enumerate}




% To build the ground truth for the evaluation, we tag the most frequently viewed posts with tag \textit{pandas} have been tagged. We have manually identified solutions lines from the accepted answer posts as well as most voted answers. We are storing following details of a stackoverflow query in our tagged dataset.
       
%  \begin{center}
%  \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c|c| } 
%  \hline
%        ques\_id & ques\_text & obj\_ques & ans\_id & sol\_id & solution & remarks \\
% \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \textbf{ques\_id:} Question id is the the psot id of question, which will help extract details about the question from stack overflow\\
% \textbf{ques\_text:} Stack overflow question text\\
% \textbf{obj\_ques:} We are only considering objective questions textit{How-to} type questions. We are ignoring the subjective questions.\\
% \textbf{ans\_id:} Post id which is most voted as well as accepted answer (if they differ) for that question.\\
% \textbf{sol\_id:} There could be multiple solutions for a question in the same answer post. These different solutions are being assigned different solution ids.\\
% \textbf{solution:} Solution code (single line as well as multi line)\\
% \textbf{remarks:} Optional field for any remarks\\

\subsubsection{Building API Documentation base}
We have processed pandas api documentation\footnote{\url{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html}} and stored the fully qualified method name and its description.
