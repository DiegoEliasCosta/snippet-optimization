We plot the per word alignment distribution as 5 point summary via box plot in \ref{fig:preliminary-results-c1} and \ref{fig:preliminary-results-c2}. The box shows the IQR which covers the 50\% of the values. The horizontal line in the box is the median. Lower the median entropy and IQR width, better the model. Although each English word maps to the limited set of code elements, there are outlier English words that map to a large number of possible elements (shown as black circles). From the table \ref{tab:alignment-entropy-mt} it can be deduced that our approaches further reduce the entropy compared to baseline.

\begin{table}[b]

\caption{Median Alignment Entropy}
\begin{tabular}{1 1 1 1 1}
		 \textbf{Approaches} 		& \textbf{All-Baseline} 		& \textbf{H1} 		& \textbf{H1H2} 	& \textbf{M1}
		 \\ 
		 \hline
		 	C1 (Title Only)						& 0.258					& 0.007				& 				& 2.59e-09
		 	\\
		 	\hline
		 	C2 (Standard NLP)						& 0.010				& 0.0002				& 0.0002				& 1.78e-09
