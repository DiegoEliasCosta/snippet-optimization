\subsection{Problem: Extracting Code Template from \stackoverflow.} 
In order to extract the templates from the \stackoverflow we need to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify the code with potential of reusability inside the code snippet and 
    \item Structure the code into a reusable form (template).  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Extracting Code.}
In terms of a SO question, we define the code with potential reusability as the \textit{solution} for the inquired question.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identifying the solution of a \stackoverflow question is by itself a very hard problem.
    \item Context dependent. To completely solve this issue we would be required to understand the usage context of the code.
    \item We restrict the domain of the problem by focusing only on API-related questions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structuring Code}
Given that we have identified the solution code of a \stackoverflow question, we need to normalize the code and structure in a form that can be further reused semi-automatically \diego{maybe automatically?}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Context dependent. Similarly to the Extracting Code problem to be able to normalize 
    \item Approach the problem in a API-centric way
    \begin{itemize}	
    	\item Identify the API calls as an entry-point.
        \item Use the API documentation to extract and normalize variable names.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
