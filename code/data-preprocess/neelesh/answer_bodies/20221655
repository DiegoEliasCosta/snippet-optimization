<p>Pandas docs says it uses openpyxl for xlsx files. Quick look through the code in <code>ExcelWriter</code> gives a clue that something like this might work out:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas
from openpyxl import load_workbook

book = load_workbook('Masterfile.xlsx')
writer = pandas.ExcelWriter('Masterfile.xlsx', engine='openpyxl') 
writer.book = book
writer.sheets = dict((ws.title, ws) for ws in book.worksheets)

data_filtered.to_excel(writer, "Main", cols=['Diff1', 'Diff2'])

writer.save()
</code></pre>
