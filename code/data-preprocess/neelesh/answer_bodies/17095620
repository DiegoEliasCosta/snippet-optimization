<p>The first part is similar to Constantine, you can get the boolean of which rows are empty*:</p>

<pre><code>In [21]: ne = (df1 != df2).any(1)

In [22]: ne
Out[22]:
0    False
1     True
2     True
dtype: bool
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can see which entries have changed:</p>

<pre><code>In [23]: ne_stacked = (df1 != df2).stack()

In [24]: changed = ne_stacked[ne_stacked]

In [25]: changed.index.names = ['id', 'col']

In [26]: changed
Out[26]:
id  col
1   score         True
2   isEnrolled    True
    Comment       True
dtype: bool
</code></pre>

<p><em>Here the first entry is the index and the second the columns which has been changed.</em></p>

<pre><code>In [27]: difference_locations = np.where(df1 != df2)

In [28]: changed_from = df1.values[difference_locations]

In [29]: changed_to = df2.values[difference_locations]

In [30]: pd.DataFrame({'from': changed_from, 'to': changed_to}, index=changed.index)
Out[30]:
               from           to
id col
1  score       1.11         1.21
2  isEnrolled  True        False
   Comment     None  On vacation
</code></pre>

<p>* Note: it's important that <code>df1</code> and <code>df2</code> share the same index here. To overcome this ambiguity, you can ensure you only look at the shared labels using <code>df1.index &amp; df2.index</code>, but I think I'll leave that as an exercise.</p>
