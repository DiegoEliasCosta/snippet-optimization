<p>This is <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#na-values-in-groupby" rel="noreferrer">mentioned in the Missing Data section of the docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NA groups in GroupBy are automatically excluded. This behavior is consistent with R, for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One workaround is to use a placeholder before doing the groupby (e.g. -1):</p>

<pre><code>In [11]: df.fillna(-1)
Out[11]: 
   a   b
0  1   4
1  2  -1
2  3   6

In [12]: df.fillna(-1).groupby('b').sum()
Out[12]: 
    a
b    
-1  2
4   1
6   3
</code></pre>

<p><em>That said, this feels pretty awful hack... perhaps there should be an option to include NaN in groupby (see <a href="https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/3729" rel="noreferrer">this github issue</a> - which uses the same placeholder hack).</em></p>
